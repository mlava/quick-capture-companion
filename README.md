This is a companion extension to the Android/iOS application Capture for Roam Research.

These applications can be installed via:
- Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lavercombe.quickCaptureRoamResearch
- App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id6450912541?platform=iphone

This companion extension will allow for the configuration of options for the Capture mobile application, although these options are currently limited. Further configuration options will become available in time.

Current configuration options via this companion extension:
- tag to apply
- whether to show or hide the markdown toolbar for text notes

The extension will also allow me to receive funding from the Roam Depot developer payments to cover development costs, Play/App store developer accounts, and ensure the apps can be listed as free in the Android and iOS App stores.

Note that the mobile app can't send notes to an encrypted graph, as Roam Research doesn't provide API tokens for encrypted graphs.
