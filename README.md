This is a companion extension to the Android/iOS application Capture for Roam Research.

These applications can be installed via:
- Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lavercombe.quickCaptureRoamResearch
- App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id6450912541?platform=iphone

## What this extension does

On first install, this extension creates a page called **"Capture for Roam Research companion"** containing:
- An authentication key for the mobile app
- Configuration options (see below)

You will be navigated to this page automatically so you can scan the authentication key with the mobile app.

## Configuration options

- Tag to apply to captured notes
- Show/hide the markdown toolbar for text notes

The extension will also allow me to receive funding from the Roam Depot developer payments to cover development costs, Play/App store developer accounts, and ensure the apps can be listed as free in the Android and iOS App stores.

The mobile application can also send to encrypted graphs using the Roam Append-Only API. Make sure to select that option when creating the API token in Roam Settings.
